# Safebikingproject

Project Roadmap:

1)Plan out biking routes using Citibike historical ride data from Summer 2019.

2)Create an Arduino sensor with GPS/LTE, Gyroscope, and Accelerometer capabilities. 

3)Over 100 rides across the routes, collect data from the sensor mounted on the bike helm. Collect the data using HTTP post requests and store those in a database.

4)After analyzing that data in Python, build a model that can predict the most stable ride from point A to point B while also providing a heatmap of average speed and stability across routes. 

5)Bring this all into Unity using Mapbox and create both an AR world scale app and VR explorable experience of the data.
